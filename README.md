# CodeSpec
Code by Specification

# Project Description
* CodeBySpecification.API - This has all the core interfaces which governs the services provided by all the layers
* UIAutomation.Base - This project holds all the different implementations of the IUIAutomationService interface. At present we have a Selenium implementation. In the future it's expected to have other UI Automation framework implementations so that we can support other UI automation frameworks other than Selenium.
* CodeBySpecification - This is the main project of the application and users should include the dll generated by this project to their test projects in order to use this system.
